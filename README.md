# Vezeeta Booking System

## Overview

- Vezeeta Booking System is a web-based healthcare appointment management platform that allows patients to search for doctors, view profiles, and book appointments easily. Inspired by the original Vezeeta service, this project aims to simulate a full-stack medical booking system with features like user registration, doctor listings, appointment scheduling, and admin controls.
